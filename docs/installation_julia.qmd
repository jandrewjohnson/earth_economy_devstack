# Installation of Hazelbean in Julia

## Install Julia

1.  On windows, Install **Julia** (which includes juliaup, the official Julia installer/manager) from the Microsoft Store: <https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NJNWW8PVKMN>
    1.  For full installation instructions here: <https://julialang.org/install/>
    2.  ![](images/paste-73.png){width="329"}
2.  Run the Julia application you just installed.
    1.  An easy way is to do this is press the start button and type Julia.
    2.  This will call `juliaup`, which is a nice tool that will get you the latest version of the actual Julia code.
    3.  ![](images/paste-72.png){width="330"}
3.  After `juliaup` is called, each subsequent time you call Julia, it will enter a Julia REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop, basically a command line instance of Julia)

## Julia Environments

1.  Julia can have different environments (configurations of packages). Managing environments is notoriously challenging, but it is important.
2.  When you called `juliaup` above, it created a default system environment, stored in your Users directory

    2.  This is the default system Julia installation. It's tempting to use *only* this, but that can quickly get confusing and cause dependency nightmares.
    3.  Better is to have specific environments tied to specific project and Git repo.

## Julia's Project.toml and Manifest.toml

A good Julia git repository will have two critical files at its project root: Project.toml and Manifest.toml. Together, these will tell your Julia how to install the exact versions of all packages needed. After you clone a repo with these files, navigate to that directory in the Command Prompt/Terminal and run:

`julia --project=. -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()'`

This will launch Julia, set the project to the current directory, and then install all of the packages in Project.toml and Manifest.toml.

## Manual adding of Packages

If you're making your own environment or need to add additional packages, you can add them via Julia's package manager. To do so:

1.  Launch Julia REPL for this project with `julia –project=.`
2.  In Julia REPL, type `]` to enter the Package manager.
3.  Install additional packages by name with something like this:

`add ArchGDAL DataFrames JuMP CSV Plots Statistics GLM Optim JSON HTTP`

When run in a project folder, this Add command will write/update the Manifest and Project files.
