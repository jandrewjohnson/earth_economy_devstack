# Installation

1.  Install git: <https://Git-scm.com/downloads>
2.  Install Miniforge3 from <https://conda-forge.org/download/>
    -   Install just for your User Account
    -   During installation, select yes for "Add Mambaforge/Miniforge to my PATH environment Variable"
3.  Create a new conda environment, activate it, and then install required packages with the following 3 mamba commands. The third command will take quite a while (10+ minutes).
    1.  `mamba create -n environment_name`
    2.  `mamba activate environment_name`
    3.  `mamba install hazelbean`
4.  Clone all desired repos
    -   To install one of our repositories, for example SEALS, you start by cloning the repo at <https://github.com/jandrewjohnson/seals_dev>.
        -   You can clone it to whatever folder you want, but if you want to switch to a Workspace configuration later, we recommend installing it in /Users/<YOUR_USERNAME>/Files/<toolname>/<repo_name> which using the SEALS example on my machine would be C:/Users/jajohns/Files/seals/seals_dev.
        -   From with your command prompt pointing at that directory, run your git command
            -   `git clone https://github.com/jandrewjohnson`
    -   Supported repositories include
        -   <https://github.com/jandrewjohnson/seals_dev>
        -   <https://github.com/jandrewjohnson/gtap_invest_dev>
        -   <https://github.com/jandrewjohnson/global_invest_dev>
        -   <https://github.com/jandrewjohnson/gtappy_dev>
5.  Install C/C++ compiler. OPTIONAL, but required for seals or recompilation of hazelbean if you change the cython/pyx files. - Windows:
    -   Option 1: You could go to <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/> and select download build tools.
    -   Option 2: Enter the following command in the Terminal: `winget install Microsoft.VisualStudio.2022.BuildTools --force --override "--passive --wait --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.VCTools;includeRecommended"` This will launch the build-tools installer (you could do this manually via the MS website if you want, but this ensures you get the right tools).
    -   Option 3: Run the install.bat file in the Earth Economy Devestack repo's root. This just runs the winget command above. - Mac:
    -   You can use Xcode to compile the cython files. Most users will already have this installed but if not, follow the directions below.
        -   If you don't have Xcode, you can get it by running `xcode-select --install` in the Terminal. This command downloads and installs the Xcode Command Line Tools, which includes gcc and clang, the compilers needed to compile C/C++ code on macOS. This is somewhat analogous to the Visual Studio Build Tools on Windows.
6.  Install the cloned repositories.
    -   Note that you probably don't want to install hazelbean this way (from the repository via pip) but instead you'll want to keep the version that came via Anaconda/Mamba.
    -   Open a command prompt in the directory where you cloned the additional repos. For the SEALS example, this would be C:\\Users\\jajohns\\Files\\seals\\seals_dev
    -   Activate the conda environment in this command prompt with the following command
        -   `mamba activate environment_name`
    -   Use pip to install the repo you as an "editable install" with the following command
        -   `pip install -e .`

One installed, the cloned repositories are all importable by python. For SEALS, you might want to start by poking around run_seals_standard.py.

**Common problems:**

-   You MUST have administrator rights to your computer.

-   If you're using Windows PowerShell (instead of the Command Prompt and it isn't working with Conda, you must initialize conda in powershell

    -   `conda init powershell`

-   If you don't add conda to your path, you can do this manually. On PC, you could use the command

    -   `SETX PATH "%PATH%;C:\Users\<YOUR_USERNAME>\miniforge3;C:\Users\<YOUR_USERNAME>\miniforge3;"`
    -   (you can do for All Users, but you will need to manually set paths to conda)
        1.  If you have an Apple “m1 or m2” chip (a relatively new apple chip, make sure you select the Apple Silicon option). - Install in `C:\Users\<YOUR_USERNAME>\miniforge3` (PC) or `~/miniconda3` (Mac)

-   If you get a “Windows Protected your PC”, click more info then Run Anyway.
