# Magpie

## Installation

git clone -b develop https://github.com/magpiemodel/magpie.git magpie_develop

Has input and output folders in gitignore

MAgpie has a config folder

default.cfg

is something huge, so use a start script which takes lines from default and overwrites.

Then in the non-ignored starts folder, has a test_runs.R

# To run gams

see start/start_functions.R
